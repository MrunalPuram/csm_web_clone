# CSM Web Applications
This repository is for the Django CSM Web project that contains the Scheduler
application (and possibly more applications to come).

## Install
We recommend running this with a Python virtual environment.

If you don't have virtualenv,
```
pip install virtualenv
```

To create the virtualenv and install dependencies,
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r csm_web/requirements.txt
```
